# MiSTer FPGA Dr. Seuss Reader "core"
With the MiSTer FPGA Dr. Seuss reader you can enjoy preserved books that the left doesn't want you to read, all from the comfort of your couch! This script based "core" will play banned books from Archive.org on the MiSTer console preserving them digially forever. None of this would be possible without the great MiSTerFPGA devs, and Discord mods. <br>

This is something that can not stand. These books can NOT be cancelled, and becasue of that we wanted to preserve them with a MiSTer FPGA core. Since a core was 100% unnecessary, we've provided a simple script that anyone can use to view the archived banned book library.<br>
